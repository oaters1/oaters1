- 👋 Heyo, I’m @oaters1 / Bryan Lu
- 📖 I have a little programming experience in Java.
- 👀 I’m interested in finding what I can stick with and learning the tech stack for it!
- 🌱 I’m currently reading SICP and learning Data Structures and Algorithms from "Introduction to Algorithms" - 3rd Ed.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, but I know very little so I don't recommend picking me up.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email at oatersbryan@gmail.com.
